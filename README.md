## Hello there,
I am an experienced software engineer, technical and people leader.

I did web development for a long while, but I've always also enjoyed operating software; I am also fascinated by large-scale distributed systems.

I currently lead a team of software engineers making business-critical enterprise Linux systems less painful, [@SUSE](https://github.com/SUSE).
