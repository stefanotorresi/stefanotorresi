## Hello there,
I am an experienced software engineer, technical and people leader.

I did web development for a long while, and I've always enjoyed software operations; I am also fascinated by large-scale distributed systems.

I currently lead a team of software engineers working on business-critical enterprise Linux systems [@SUSE](https://github.com/SUSE).
